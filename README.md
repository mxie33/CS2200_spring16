================

###Micro-Project1:

- Code fibonacci using recursion in MIPS Assembly language in LC-2200
- Write test.s for the testing fibonacci.s
- Grade: 100/100

###Project 1:

- Build a 16 bit LC-2200 processor in non-pipeline architechture and test it using fib.s in microproject1
- Implmented Microcode for the main ROM to control the sequence of the microstates for a specific instruction
- Grade: 85/100

###Project 2:

- Build a 32 bit LC-2200 processor in pipeline architechture and test it using test code
- Grade: 90/100 (It was 100/100, but 10 points off for late submission)

###Micro-Project2:

- Run programs using gdb
- Use gdb's instruction to debug for programs in C
- Grade: 100/100
