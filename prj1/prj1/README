In this section of the project, you will need to compute the "control bit
strings" for your microcontroller. Control bit strings will be used to decidew
which signal is high (1) for a certain state. For example, let us look as
FETCH macro state.

In FETCH you get the next instruction from memory, and put it in the IR. At the
same time, you also increment the PC. For LC 2200, this takes 3 clock cycles:
Let us look at which signals need to be high for FETCH0:
DrPC -> To drive the value of PC on to the bus
LdMar -> To load the PC value in the memory access register
LdA -> Time saving trip to load current PC into one of the ALU registers.
NEXT STATE -> FETCH1

This means that all the signals except for the above mentioned need to be low (0)

We get the following bit string for the FETCH0 state. Why?
 
000000000011000100000000101

which translates to the following hex value:

0006201

Note: The 1 in the right most location is part of the next state bits. Since the
next state will have an address of 0x1, this bit is high.

Now, your task is to compute the bit string for all MACRO states of each instruction
in the ISA, and convert them to hex.

For this purpose fill in ones in the appropriate control signals in the provided
spreadsheet file.
