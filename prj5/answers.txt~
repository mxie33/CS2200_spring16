Problem 1B
----------

./os-sim 1 (cpu = 1)
# of Context Switches: 99
Total execution time: 67.6 s
Total time spent in READY state: 389.9 s

./os-sim 2 (cpu = 2)
# of Context Switches: 106
Total execution time: 36.5 s
Total time spent in READY state: 87.9 s

./os-sim 4 (cpu = 4)
# of Context Switches: 184
Total execution time: 33.1 s
Total time spent in READY state: 0.8 s

The number of CPUs has a negative relation with total execution time, but it's not a linear relationship, because when cpu increase from 1 to 2, there's a over 30s decrease in execution time, while for the increase from 2 to 4, there's only about 3s decrease in execution time. When you increase the number of cpu from 2 to 4, we can see that some of the cpus in those 4 are idel. We can see that keep increasing the number of cpu will not always be efficient.


Problem 2B
----------
800ms
# of Context Switches: 136
Total execution time: 67.6 s
Total time spent in READY state: 325.4 s

600ms
# of Context Switches: 161
Total execution time: 67.6 s
Total time spent in READY state: 314.5 s

400ms
# of Context Switches: 202
Total execution time: 67.6 s
Total time spent in READY state: 299.0 s

# of Context Switches: 362
Total execution time: 67.5 s
Total time spent in READY state: 285.2 

Because in real life, there will be a huge amount of context switches which will waste a lot of time and cause inefficiency.

Problem 3B
----------
fifo 1cpu
# of Context Switches: 99
Total execution time: 67.6 s
Total time spent in READY state: 389.9 s

rr 1cpu with quantum = 500ms
# of Context Switches: 175
Total execution time: 67.7 s
Total time spent in READY state: 301.8 s

sp 1cpu
# of Context Switches: 168
Total execution time: 68.8 s
Total time spent in READY state: 137.1 s

sp has the optimal waiting time, so static priority is the cloest approximation of SJF.
We can explain that in SFJ, 1/(excution time) can be viewed as a priority.s
